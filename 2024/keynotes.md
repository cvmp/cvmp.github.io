#### Aljosa Smolic, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts <br> 

[//]: # (We are witnessing an impressive pace of innovation happening in the generative AI space. 2D image domain is often at the frontier of this innovation followed by trends to extend the success to domains such as videos or 3D. While they seem as different domains, one can argue that these domains are in fact very much connected. In this talk, I will talk about some recent efforts that leverage the knowledge of foundational models trained for a particular domain to address tasks in other domains. I will also present thoughts around future opportunities that can leverage this tight connection to go towards universal generation models.)

*Prof. Dr. Aljosa Smolic is Professor in the Computer Science Department of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Switzerland and Co-Head of the Immersive Realities Research Lab. Before he was Professor of Creative Technologies at Trinity College Dublin heading the research group V-SENSE, Senior Research Scientist and Group Leader at Disney Research Zurich, and Scientific Project Manager and Group Leader at Fraunhofer HHI. He is also a Co-Founder of the company Volograms, which commercializes volumetric video technology. Prof. Smolic’s expertise is in the broad area of visual computing (covering image/video processing, computer vision, computer graphics) with a focus on immersive XR technologies. He published 250+ scientific papers and book chapters, holds 35+ patents and received several awards and recognitions for his research.*

#### Ana Serrano, Universidad de Zaragoza <br> Understanding user behavior and attention in immersive environments

Virtual reality (VR) is an exciting and rapidly growing medium that presents both challenges and opportunities. As VR techniques and applications continue to blossom, creating engaging experiences that exploit their potential becomes increasingly important. Understanding and being able to reliably predict human visual behavior is an essential factor in achieving this goal. This knowledge can be the key to designing more engaging storytelling experiences and developing efficient content-aware compression and rendering techniques that take into account users’ attentional patterns and behavior. In this talk, we will explore approaches and challenges involved in modeling visual attention and gaze behavior in immersive 360º environments. By studying how users allocate their attention and direct their gaze, we can uncover valuable insights for creating immersive VR experiences.

*Ana Serrano is an Associate Professor at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). Previously she was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics. She received her PhD in Computer Science in 2019. Her doctoral thesis was recognized with one of the Eurographics 2020 PhD awards and she was recognized with the Eurographics Young Researcher Award in 2023 and the VGTC Significant New Researcher Award in 2024. Her research focuses on various areas of visual computing, including computational imaging, material appearance perception and editing, and virtual reality. She is particularly interested in using perceptually-driven approaches to improve user experiences and develop tools to assist content creation.*
