## 6â€“7 December 2021, Knowledge Centre, British Library, London, UK

Welcome to the ACM SIGGRAPH European Conference on Visual Media Production (CVMP). For years, CVMP has built a reputation as the prime venue for researchers to meet with practitioners in the Creative Industries.

CVMP brings together production and post-production specialists from the worlds of film, broadcast and games with imaging and graphics researchers; it brings together expertise in video processing, computer vision, computer graphics, animation and physical simulation.

CVMP provides a European forum for presentation of the latest research and application advances, combined with keynote and invited talks on state-of-the-art industry practice.

In this 18<sup>th</sup> edition of the conference, we are proud to be officially affiliated to and sponsored by [ACM SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org).

### COVID-19 ###

We plan to organise CVMP as an in-person conference in London. We will introduce a range of safety measures that all attendees will be required to follow to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Those measures will be announced nearer the date of the conference.

We encourage all speakers and presenters to attend in-person, but we will make special arrangements for those speakers who cannot travel because of COVID-19 risks or restrictions.

In case it becomes impossible to organize a physical conference, the conference may need to move to a virtual platform.
