#### Angjoo Kanazawa, UC Berkeley <br> Perceiving Humans and Objects in the 3D World


*Angjoo Kanazawa is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. She is also a Research Scientist at Google Research. Her research lies at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. The goal of her lab is to build a system that can capture, perceive, and understand the underlying dynamic 3D world behind everyday photographs and videos, including deformable objects such as humans and animals. Previously, Prof. Kanazawa was a BAIR postdoc at UC Berkeley advised by Jitendra Malik, Alexei A. Efros and Trevor Darrell. She completed her PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park advised by David Jacobs. During her PhD, she had the pleasure to visit the Max Planck Institute in TÃ¼bingen, Germany under the guidance of Michael Black. Prior to that, Prof. Kanazawa completed her BA in Mathematics and Computer Science at NYU. She has been named a Rising Star in EECS and is a recipient of Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship. Her work on learning 3D deformation of animals from 2D images won the best paper award at Eurographics 2016.*
