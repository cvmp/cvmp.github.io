## Code of Conduct

CVMP 2025 will be adopting a code of conduct for attendees in line with the [ACM Policy Against Harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and the [CVPR Code of Conduct](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/node/27), as established for our research community:

* CVMP 2025 is committed to providing an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas. It is the policy of CVMP 2025 that all participants of conference activities (presentations, networking sessions, social events, etc.) will enjoy a welcoming environment free from unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.

* Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in the country in which the conference or program is being held. Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances. Any report of harassment at one of our activities will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

* Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their booths and must refrain from the use of sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise creating a sexualized environment. Speakers should not use sexual language or images without scientific purpose, or any language or images that would constitute harassment as defined above in their talks.

* Violations should be reported to the conference chairs ([contact@cvmp-conference.org](mailto:contact@cvmp-conference.org)). All reports will be treated confidentially. The chairs will investigate and prepare a brief statement of facts, a conclusion (proven/not proven) using a preponderance of the evidence standard, and a recommended sanction if a violation is proven. The conference standards committee will vote to either adopt or not adopt this recommendation and may modify it. The decision of the committee is final. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, exclusion from one or more conference events, exclusion from the entire conference, removal of material from the online record of the conference, referral to the violator's university or employer, and referral to law enforcement. In no case will registration fees or expenses be refunded by the conference.

**All CVMP 2025 attendees and exhibitors are expected to comply with these standards of behaviour.**
